abstract  ="Single crystal (SC) layered lithium metal oxides (LiNixCoyMnzO2{,} referred to as NCMs or NMCs) represent a new material design with unique benefits compared to their polycrystalline counterparts. However{,} preparation of SC-NCMs remains challenging{,} with methods such as molten salt synthesis being largely dependent on recipe-by-recipe reporting and no overarching conception of how to prepare desirable materials. For a model NCM{,} LiNiO2 (LNO){,} we use experimental design methodology to identify how the factors of salt selection{,} salt mixtures{,} and molar salt ratio affect the critical features of grain size{,} crystal defect content (){,} and particle size distribution. Herein{,} we identify that NaCl and KCl are salts which can be used to control particle size at relatively low defect content{,} while sulfate-containing salts are deleterious to quality LNO. The results of this work set out to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how others could prepare well-ordered SC-NCMs of specific particle size."}

abstract = {The second-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using the layered LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 cathode material have a wide range of applications from electronics to electric vehicles due to their high volumetric and gravimetric capacity, high nominal voltage, and low self-discharge. Considering the performance of LIBs depends on the composition, crystallography, morphology, and other parameters during synthesis, interest in developing high-performance LIBs has motivated researchers to develop novel synthesis methods to precisely control these parameters. Significant progress has been made in the advancement of several synthesis methods such as coprecipitation, sol-gel, hydrothermal, and solid-state. Moreover, new methods such as Pechini, combustion, emulsion-drying, and RAPET method have been successfully utilized to synthesize LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2. Motivated by this rapid advancement, this review paper presents all synthesis methods used for the production of crystalline LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 for LIBs and discusses the effect of various synthesis parameters on the properties of the cathode material and battery performance. The research summaries in this work are targeted to provide researchers in the battery industry with a pathway for deciding the synthesis conditions for LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 production. This work highlights the challenges associated with each synthesis method and motivates researchers to further investigate and enhance these methods to achieve the highest performance of LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2.}
