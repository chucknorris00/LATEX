ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, lithium-ion batteries are undoubtedly known as the most promising rechargeable batteries. However, these batteries face some big challenges, like not having enough energy and not lasting long enough, that should be addressed. Ternary Ni-rich Li[NixCoyMnz]O2 and Li[NixCoyAlz]O2 cathode materials stand as the ideal candidate for a cathode active material to achieve high capacity and energy density, low manufacturing cost, and high operating voltage. However, capacity gain from Ni enrichment is nullified by the concurrent fast capacity fading because of issues such as gas evolution, microcracks propagation and pulverization, phase transition, electrolyte decomposition, cation mixing, and dissolution of transition metals at high operating voltage, which hinders their commercialization. In order to tackle these problems, researchers conducted many strategies, including elemental doping, surface coating, and particle engineering. This review paper mainly talks about origins of problems and their mechanisms leading to electrochemical performance deterioration for Ni-rich cathode materials and modification approaches to address the problems.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding the rapid advances in electric vehicles for supplanting internal combustion engines, the widespread adoption of lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles remains hindered owing to their relatively low power density, which correlates with their charging time. In this study, the ionic and electronic conduction properties of electrodes were balanced by rationally designing the physical properties of the electrodes. The optimized NCA/conductive additive composite electrode required only 8.2 min for charging to 80 of the state of charge. This work paves the way to achieve extreme fast charging, thus helping to usher in a new era of electric vehicles.}

abstract = {Life cycle optimization (LCO) refers to the integration of objectives calculated using a life-cycle based framework into mathematical optimization problems. Application of LCO may allow for substantial sustainability improvements in many industrial sectors, and provide valuable decision support towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This study performed a PRISMA systematic review of LCO literature published between 2012 and 2023 with the goal of developing general guidelines for performance of LCO studies. Three hundred and one sources were reviewed to determine the industrial sector of the modeled system, the life cycle assessment framework used, how objective functions were defined, if uncertainty was included, and the optimization framework used. Results indicate a shift towards evolutionary-based optimization methods relative to previous reviews of the literature. Economic and environmental objective functions were most commonly assessed, while some studies have begun incorporating social objectives into their optimization. Based on the collected data, additional discussion was included related to choice of optimization framework, and definition of objective functions. The collected data and these additional discussions were used to develop a decision tree to aid practitioners in making methodological choices when performing LCO studies. This decision tree will help practitioners manage the trade-offs between the accuracy and efficiency of optimization methods based on the goals of their particular LCO study, and support increased uptake of LCO methodologies across industrial sectors. Increased uptake may provide significant value to researchers and policy makers by enabling investigation of potential sustainability improvement measures where all metrics are simultaneously optimized.},

journal = {Journal of The Electrochemical Society},
abstract = {-based olivine compounds were prepared by the usual ceramic method, where some modifications were carried out in order to improve the electrical conductivity of the cathode compound. Considering that the cathode is made up of electrochemical active particles and a nonactive polymer binder, two different methods were applied. The first one is related to the improvement of the interparticle conduction, and the other is the enhancement of the conductivity in the active particle itself. The former was attained with thermal decomposition of an organic additive (pyrene) during the sample preparation process, and the precipitated carbon was investigated with Raman spectroscopy. The bulk conductivity of the olivine was improved with a partial substitution of  with , where the holes were incorporated into the valence band. These modifications significantly altered the electrochemical properties of the olivine cathode: large specific capacity  and small capacity fading. Although the importance of carbon deposition was confirmed as reported elsewhere, the structural modification effect was also more important than the surface one. The result will contribute to reduce carbon content of -based positive electrodes, which is important for their practical use.}

abstract = {The second-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using the layered LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 cathode material have a wide range of applications from electronics to electric vehicles due to their high volumetric and gravimetric capacity, high nominal voltage, and low self-discharge. Considering the performance of LIBs depends on the composition, crystallography, morphology, and other parameters during synthesis, interest in developing high-performance LIBs has motivated researchers to develop novel synthesis methods to precisely control these parameters. Significant progress has been made in the advancement of several synthesis methods such as coprecipitation, sol-gel, hydrothermal, and solid-state. Moreover, new methods such as Pechini, combustion, emulsion-drying, and RAPET method have been successfully utilized to synthesize LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2. Motivated by this rapid advancement, this review paper presents all synthesis methods used for the production of crystalline LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 for LIBs and discusses the effect of various synthesis parameters on the properties of the cathode material and battery performance. The research summaries in this work are targeted to provide researchers in the battery industry with a pathway for deciding the synthesis conditions for LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 production. This work highlights the challenges associated with each synthesis method and motivates researchers to further investigate and enhance these methods to achieve the highest performance of LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2.}

These come across as ultrafine dispersions whose differential drug loading; viscoelastic as well as visual properties can cater to a wide range of functionalities including drug delivery. However there is still relatively narrow insight regarding development, manufacturing, fabrication and manipulation of nanoemulsions which primarily stems from the fact that conventional aspects of emulsion formation and stabilization only partially apply to nanoemulsions. This general deficiency sets up the premise for current review. We attempt to explore varying intricacies, excipients, manufacturing techniques and their underlying principles, production conditions, structural dynamics, prevalent destabilization mechanisms, and drug delivery applications of nanoemulsions to spike interest of those contemplating a foray in this field.}
