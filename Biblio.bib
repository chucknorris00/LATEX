ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, lithium-ion batteries are undoubtedly known as the most promising rechargeable batteries. However, these batteries face some big challenges, like not having enough energy and not lasting long enough, that should be addressed. Ternary Ni-rich Li[NixCoyMnz]O2 and Li[NixCoyAlz]O2 cathode materials stand as the ideal candidate for a cathode active material to achieve high capacity and energy density, low manufacturing cost, and high operating voltage. However, capacity gain from Ni enrichment is nullified by the concurrent fast capacity fading because of issues such as gas evolution, microcracks propagation and pulverization, phase transition, electrolyte decomposition, cation mixing, and dissolution of transition metals at high operating voltage, which hinders their commercialization. In order to tackle these problems, researchers conducted many strategies, including elemental doping, surface coating, and particle engineering. This review paper mainly talks about origins of problems and their mechanisms leading to electrochemical performance deterioration for Ni-rich cathode materials and modification approaches to address the problems.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding the rapid advances in electric vehicles for supplanting internal combustion engines, the widespread adoption of lithium-ion battery-powered electric vehicles remains hindered owing to their relatively low power density, which correlates with their charging time. In this study, the ionic and electronic conduction properties of electrodes were balanced by rationally designing the physical properties of the electrodes. The optimized NCA/conductive additive composite electrode required only 8.2 min for charging to 80 of the state of charge. This work paves the way to achieve extreme fast charging, thus helping to usher in a new era of electric vehicles.}

abstract = {Abstract Representatives of the LixNi1−y−zCoyMnzO2 (NCM) family of cathode active materials (CAMs) with high nickel content are becoming the CAM of choice for high performance lithium-ion batteries. In addition to high specific capacities, these layered oxides offer high specific energy, power, and long cycle life. Recently, the development of single crystalline particles of NCM has enabled even longer lifetimes due to achieving higher Coulomb efficiencies. In this work, the performance of NCM materials with different particle size and morphology is explored in terms of key parameters such as the charge-transfer resistance and the chemical diffusion coefficient of lithium. Cracking of secondary particles leads to liquid electrolyte infiltration in the CAM, lowering the charge-transfer resistance and increasing the apparent diffusion coefficient by more than one order of magnitude. In contrast, these effects are not observed with single-crystalline NCM, which is mostly free of cracks after cycling. Consequently, severe kinetic limitations are observed when cycling large “uncracked” secondary particles at low potential and capacity. These results demonstrate that cracking of polycrystalline particles of NCM is not solely detrimental but helps to achieve high reversible capacities and rate capability. Thus, optimization of CAMs size and morphology is decisive to achieve good rate capability with high-nickel NCMs.},

abstract = {-based olivine compounds were prepared by the usual ceramic method, where some modifications were carried out in order to improve the electrical conductivity of the cathode compound. Considering that the cathode is made up of electrochemical active particles and a nonactive polymer binder, two different methods were applied. The first one is related to the improvement of the interparticle conduction, and the other is the enhancement of the conductivity in the active particle itself. The former was attained with thermal decomposition of an organic additive (pyrene) during the sample preparation process, and the precipitated carbon was investigated with Raman spectroscopy. The bulk conductivity of the olivine was improved with a partial substitution of  with , where the holes were incorporated into the valence band. These modifications significantly altered the electrochemical properties of the olivine cathode: large specific capacity  and small capacity fading. Although the importance of carbon deposition was confirmed as reported elsewhere, the structural modification effect was also more important than the surface one. The result will contribute to reduce carbon content of -based positive electrodes, which is important for their practical use.}

abstract = {The second-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using the layered LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 cathode material have a wide range of applications from electronics to electric vehicles due to their high volumetric and gravimetric capacity, high nominal voltage, and low self-discharge. Considering the performance of LIBs depends on the composition, crystallography, morphology, and other parameters during synthesis, interest in developing high-performance LIBs has motivated researchers to develop novel synthesis methods to precisely control these parameters. Significant progress has been made in the advancement of several synthesis methods such as coprecipitation, sol-gel, hydrothermal, and solid-state. Moreover, new methods such as Pechini, combustion, emulsion-drying, and RAPET method have been successfully utilized to synthesize LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2. Motivated by this rapid advancement, this review paper presents all synthesis methods used for the production of crystalline LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 for LIBs and discusses the effect of various synthesis parameters on the properties of the cathode material and battery performance. The research summaries in this work are targeted to provide researchers in the battery industry with a pathway for deciding the synthesis conditions for LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 production. This work highlights the challenges associated with each synthesis method and motivates researchers to further investigate and enhance these methods to achieve the highest performance of LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2.}

Here{,} we report on single crystal Ni-rich NMCs with improved cycling stability and ultra-high tap density up to 3.0 g cm−3 coupled with high discharge capacity{,} resulting in enhanced volumetric energy density of prepared electrodes up to 2680 W h L−1. Record tap density is achieved due to the formation of single crystal particles with spherical-like shapes through adjustment of the lithium chemical potential by using K2SO4 as a solvent during the single crystal growth. The designed single crystal NMC622 and NMC811 cathode materials are promising for applications in batteries with high specific energy and long-term cycling life."}
